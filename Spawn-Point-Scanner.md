This page describes a newly introduced feature that simplifies setting spawn-points for FFA arenas.

# Spawn-Point Scanner
Spawn-Point Scanner is a feature that allows you to **place beacon blocks and scan them thoroughly in a specific region, in which these beacons will be translated as spawn-point locations.**

This way, you would not need to run the spawn-point command for every index individually.

# How to use

 1. Run **/\<mode> arena spawnpoint \<arena> _scan_**.
 2. Upon running the command, you will be given 2 tools: 
    1. The region wand
    2. A beacon
  3. Select the region you would like to scan for beacons using the region wand, just like WorldEdit's wand. **Left click to set first position**, and **right click to set the second position**.
  4. After selecting the region, run `/<mode> arena spawnpoint <arena> scan` again. This time, it will scan the entire region and look for beacon blocks.
